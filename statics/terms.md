# numeric
data that are expressed on a numeric scale
## continuous (interval, float, numeric)
data that can take on any value in an interval
## discrete (integer, count)
data that can take on only integer values, such as counts.

# categorical (enums, enumerated, factors, nominal)
data that can take on only a specific set of values representing a set of
    possible categories

    outcome, the features are sometimes used to predict the outcome in an 
    experiment or a study

# mean (average)
the sum of all values divided by the number of values

# weighted mean (weighted average)
the sum of all values times a weight divided by the sum of the weights

# median (50th percentile)
the value such that one-half of the data lies above and below

# percentile (quantile)
the value such that P percent of the data lies blow

# weighted median
the value such that one-half of the sum of the weights lies above and blow the
    sorted data

# trimmed mean (truncated mean)
the average of all values after dropping a fixed number of extreme values

# robust (resistant)
not sensitive to extreme values

# outlier 
a data value that is very different from most of the data
