# model an asynchronous program flow
Threads, futures, fibers, goroutines, promises, etc. are abstractions that
give us a way to model an asynchronous program flow.

# Cooperative
Yield voluntarily
- async/await in Rust and JavaScript

# Non-cooperative
Don't necessarily yield voluntarily, the scheduler must be able to pre-empt
a running task.
- Os threads
- Goroutines

# Stackful
Each task has its own call stack.
- Os threads
- fiber
Stackful tasks can suspend execution at any point in the program as the whole
stack is preserved.

# Stackless
There is not a separate stack for each task, all run sharing the same call 
stack.
- rust futures generated by async/await
A task can't be suspended in the middle of a stack frame.
