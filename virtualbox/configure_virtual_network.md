# Network Address Translation (NAT)
allows the VM to talk to the Internet but which does not allow multile VM hosts
    to talk to each other

# NAT Network option
allows hosts to communicate with each other on the virtual network as well as
    the outside world through a virtual router
the limitation of the NAT Network option is that it does not allow communication
    from the physical host into the virtual network 
    (can be overcome if necessary)
